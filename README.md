# autopkg-recipes
Yet another collection of custom Autopkg recipes for macOS installers.

## Mostly for Workspace ONE
These are mostly made for use with VMWARE Workspace ONE, using custom processor [WorkSpaceOneImporter](https://github.com/codeskipper/WorkSpaceOneImporter)
There're based on tried and tested parent recipes for munki.
Recipes are tested and working for ws1 unless otherwise marked in notes field.

## yaml preferred
After initial test with plist version recipe for ws1 with Suspicious Package succeeded, next step was to try yaml format recipes as suggested by [Graham Pugh](https://github.com/grahampugh) - see https://grahamrpugh.com/2021/03/02/autopkg-native-yaml-recipes.html. I've never looked back.
